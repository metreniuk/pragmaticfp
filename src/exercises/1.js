Notes for me:
This is probably the last time you will and should write alert
Let's see what we did. We just passed a function to a button 
to be executed when somebody clicks on the button.
This is called a callback. The main point is that we have somebody
who will call our function instead of us.

// Don't touch it ðŸ‘€(at least if you don't know what you are doing).
