Exercise 4
Theory: Elm (redux) architecture
Practice: First reducer

/*
Notes for me:
- The data flow diagram
- The reducer should be a pure function
- Why is it important? Because it is totally predictable. 
  You can see what is happening in the system. 
  Nothing is hidden (bugs included).
- Reducer always returns a state
*/

// ğŸ¦„: The reducer should return a NEW state based on the action it receives.
// The action has a "type" property that indicates what is happening in the app.
// -----------
// The actions that can be dispatched are:
// - {type: 'INCREMENT'} the new state should be greater by one
// - {type: 'DECREMENT'} the new state should be less by one
// The state is a number that is the value of the counter.
function reducer(state, action) {
  // Write you code here ğŸ‘‡

  // the reducer should always return the state
  // even if it's not modifying it
  return state;
}

// ğŸŒˆThis is a fancy way to write html inside JavaScript
// think of it just as html on steroids.
// Don't touch it ğŸ‘€(at least if you don't know what you are doing).
